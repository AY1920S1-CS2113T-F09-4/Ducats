== PROJECT: Ducats
'''
== About the Project
Amateur musicians find it difficult to start with music theory as they are unable to see their work being shown in a practical method and quit. Our application allows amateur musicians to learn music theory and apply their learning by creating songs.  Ducats consists of the following:  

Intuitive tutorials 

Ducats aims to make music theory easy through the use of step by step tutorial on how this command is related to music theory. This will allow the user to be constantly guided when each command is written and the app has an autocomplete feature, so that the user does not need to always remember the commands. It will also have autocorrect when the user misspells a command. 

Ease of adding, deleting components to the songs

The user is able to add, delete, edit and view components such as bars, notes, groups to the song so that they learn the  basics of creating a song. 

Displaying the musical notes as sheets so that they can practice it in their favorite instrument. 

In the end once the user uses the application, they will be able to take away a pdf of their musical notes and also print it in command line.  

== Summary of Contributions

I implemented the Overlay feature and the view functionality for a song as main features and autocorrect as an enhancement feature. 

Enhancements added:

* AutoCorrect

_What it does_: This feature was built to ensure that the system can autocorrect for minor mistakes while typing the commands such as helo instead of help. There is no need to call a command to get the closest command but rather it will automatically try to understand the command that is being typed. 

_Justification_: This gives the user a better experience as it is hard to always type the command without a typo 

_Highlights_: The feature works on the basis of the Jaccard theorem that finds the intersection between the 2 words and divides it by the union of the 2 words and hence gets the word with the highest ratio and is above a threshold as to account for random inputs. 


* Converting a song into a string for comparison (Used by View function)

_What it does_: This feature converts the song object into a string with "|" separating bars for easy testing. 

_Justification_: This is an important feature as testing if the output from the program is difficult as our Song object consists of different objects within such as notes, chords, etc. 

_Highlights_: This feature can be viewed by the users when they type `view <song name> `


* Overlay functionalities

_What it does_: These functions overlay different components of a song together - allows the freedom to overlay a bar-bar, bar-group, group - group. 
 

_Justification_: For any musician, having the freedom to overlay a part of one song to another (overlaps two components and we play the 2 components together at the same time)  will save them a lot of time and also make it easier for them to create a composition.

_Highlights_: This feature allows you to overlay components that are of 2 different length (2 groups of 2 different length)

* Deep copy of elements 

_What it does_: I implemented the functionality to deep copy song components as the usual java copy function did not work as we are using custom classes. Hence had to  serialize it before able to copy the custom class. The serialize was performed using the java..io.Serializable
 

_Justification_: We had to use deep copy in some instances as copying by reference changed the main element, which is not what we want.

== Contributions to the User Guide

The following section shows my contribution to the user guide, namely the description of the overlay, , navigation, data storage and metronome features, as well as my explanation of the attributes that make up a song in Ducats.

_(Excerpt from Ducats User Guide starts here)_

=== Combining sections of music:
For any musician, having the freedom to overlay a part of one song to another (overlaps two components and we play the 2 components together at the same time)  will save them a lot of time and also make it easier for them to create a composition. The overlay function aims to perform this functionality and allows the freedom to overlay a bar-bar, bar-group, group - group. 

==== Combining bar-bar: `overlay`

This command allows the user to overlay a bar from the same song to another bar on the same song, i.e. opened song. To change the song please use the `open` command

_Format_:
`overlay <bar_num to be overlayed> <bar_num to be overlayed to>`

_Example_: `overlay 1 2`


The above command overlays bar 1 onto bar 2 (see Figure 3.4 for example demo). 

image::overlay_1_2.png[]
Figure 3.4: overlaying of bar 1 onto bar 2.


The repeat parameter can be added to the end to overlay the bar from the required start point till the end. 

_Format_:
`overlay <bar_num to be overlayed> <bar_num to be overlayed to> repeat`

_Example_: `overlay 1 3 repeat`


The above command overlays bar 1 onto bar 3 and onwards. 

The output will be an ascii printed version of the song after overlaying. 


==== Combining group-group: `overlay_group_group`
Allows the users to overlay a group from one song to another. The interesting aspect of this feature is that it allows the users to overlay groups of unequal length, i.e. a group with a larger number of bars onto a group with a smaller number of bars and vice versa. The following example shows what will happen when combining two unequal groups:  


* Group 1: {Bar X Bar Y} 
* Group 2 : {Bar A Bar B Bar C Bar D}
* Overlaying Group 1 onto Group 2:  { [Bar A + Bar X] [Bar B + Bar Y] [Bar C + Bar X] [Bar D + Bar Y]}   
* Overlaying Group 2 onto Group 1: { [Bar A + Bar X] [Bar B + Bar Y]} 

_Format_:

`overlay_group_group <song_name to be overlayed from> <group_number> <song_name to be overlayed to> <group_number>`

_Example_: `overlay_group_group twinkle 1 jingle 3`

The above command overlays group 1 from twinkle onto group 4 of jingle 

_Example_: `overlay_group_group twinkle 1 twinkle 2`

If group 1 from twinkle is overlayed onto group 2 of twinkle, where group 1 contains bar 1 to 2 and group 2 consists of bar 3 to 5. See Figure 3.5 for example) 

image::example_song_annotation.png[]
Figure 3.5: Example song 


The output of the above command ( `overlay_group_group twinkle 1 twinkle 2` ) must be (Figure 3.6): 

image::overlay_group_group_1_2.png[]
Figure 3.6: `overlay_group_group twinkle 1 twinkle 2` 


If we try to run `overlay_group_group twinkle 2 twinkle 1` (Figure 3.7) 

The output will be: 

image::overlay_group_group_2_1.png[]
Figure 3.7: `overlay_group_group twinkle 2 twinkle 1`

The repeat parameter can be added to the end to overlay the group from the required start point till the end. 

_Format_:
`overlay_group_group <song_name to be overlayed from> <group_number> <song_name to be overlayed to> <group_number> repeat`

_Example_: `overlay_group_group twinkle 1 jingle 3 repeat`


The above command overlays group 1 onto jingle's group 4 and onwards. 


If the indexes does not exist then an exception is thrown. 


==== Combining bar-group: `overlay_bar_group`

Allows the users to overlay a  bar onto a group from the same song, i.e. opened song. To change the song please use the `open` command. It works in the similar way as the `overlay` commands. The repeat parameter allows the user to overlay through all the groups from the specified starting group. 


_Format_:

`overlay_bar_group <bar_number to be overlayed> <group_number to be overlayed to>`

_Example_: `overlay_bar_group 1 2`


The above command overlays bar 1 from the opened song onto group 2. 

If the group 2 was from bar 3 to 5 on the following song (Figure 3.8): 
image::example_song_annotation.png[]
Figure 3.8: Example song 

The expected output will be (Figure 3.9): 

image::overlay_bar_group_1_2.png[]
Figure 3.9: `overlay_bar_group 1 2`

The repeat parameter can be added to the end to overlay the bar from the required start point till the last group. 

_Format_:
`overlay_bar_group <bar_number to be overlayed> <group_number to be overlayed to> repeat`

_Example_: `overlay_bar_group 1 3 repeat`


The above command will allow the user to overlay bar 1 to group 3 and onwards till the end of group lists. 

The output will be an ascii printed version of the song after overlaying. 


==== Combining bars across songs: `overlay_bar_song`


This command allows the user to overlay a bar from one song to another song's bar. 

_Format_:
`overlay_bar_song <song_name to be overlayed from> <bar_number> <song_name to be overlayed to> <bar_number>`


_Example_: `overlay_bar_song twinkle 3 jingle 4`


The above command overlays bar 3 from twinkle onto bar 4 of jingle 

The repeat parameter can be added to the end to overlay the bar from the required start point till the end. 

_Format_:
`overlay_bar_song <song_name to be overlayed from> <bar_number> <song_name to be overlayed to> <bar_number> repeat`

_Example_: `overlay_bar_song twinkle 3 jingle 4 repeat`


The above command overlays bar 3 onto jingle's bar 4 and onwards. 

The output will be an ascii printed version of the song after overlaying.

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

The following section shows my conreibution to Ducats' Developer Guide, namely the section explaining the overlay functions, how to include a new function and how logging and testing were conducted.

_(Excerpt from Ducats Developer Guide starts here)_

==== Overlay
For any musician, having the freedom to overlay a part of one song to another (overlaps two components and we play the 2 components together at the same time)  will save them a lot of time and also make it easier for them to create a composition. The overlay function aims to perform this functionality and allows the freedom to overlay a bar-bar , bar-group, group - group. See Figure 1.4 for an example.

image::overlay_1_2.png[]
Figure 1.4 - Example of `overlay 1 2`


`overlay`: 

`overlay <bar_num to be overlayed> <bar_num to be overlayed to>`

Allows the users to overlay a bar from the same song to another bar on the same song. This feature is really useful when the song is really big and we just need to get the index of the bars to be overlayed and the overlaying bar. 

*How to go about it?* 

The `overlay` command gets the command from the Parser and checks if all the required parameters are provided by spliting the string by spaces. For instance if the user inputs 1 number instead of 2, then a DucatsException is thrown. 

The index of the current Song is obtained by calling the `getActiveIndex()` function of SongList. 

    songList.getActiveIndex();

After which the required song is obtained by calling the `getSongIndex(songIndex)` function of SongList: 

    songList.getSongIndex(songIndex);

The list of bars of the song are obtained by calling the getter function 

    song.getBars(); 

After which, we try to get the bar depending on the user's input (user's input - 1 because in Ducats we use a 1 based indexing) 

We make a copy of the overlayingBar by calling the `copy` function of the bar. 

    Bar.copy(bar_to_be_copied); 

This function returns a bar and hence allows us to pass the bar by value rather than reference. Therefore,any modification does not affect the overlaying bar. 

We create a `Combiner` class, which combines 2 same components of a song. 

    combiner = new Combiner(); 

After creating the combiner, we check if there is any 3rd parameter (`repeat`) to repeat the overlaying throughout the song from the bar that needs to be overlayed to.



If there is a `repeat` parameter, we will call the `repeatLoop` function. This uses an iterator to loop through the array of bars. An iterator was used as it allows us to modify the object in the array while looping through it. The current index of the loop is stored in the form of a variable.

If the condition is fulfilled,  we call the combiner's `combineBar` function.

    combiner.combineBar(Bar_to_be_combined_on, Bar_to_be_combined_to);

We repeat this process till the end of the array list. 

If there is no repeat function, then we just get the bar to be overlayed from the array and call the combiner's `combineBar` function. 

After which, we call the `updatefile` function of storage to store the new song and then return the string from the `execute` function of ascii to properly display the new song to the user through the UI. Below is the sequence diagram for the overlay function (Figure 1.5): 


image::overlaysequencediagram.png[]
Figure 1.5 - `overlay` command sequence diagram

==== overlay_bar_song


`overlay_bar_song`: 

`overlay_bar_song <song_name to be overlayed from> <bar_number> <song_name to be overlayed to> <bar_number>`
 
Allows the users to overlay a bar from a different song to another bar from another song. This especially useful when the composer has already made a song or liked a part of a song from another composer. 


*How to go about it?* 


The command is sent from the parser class and appropriate checking of the command is done to check if the user has inputed the right number of parameters by splitting the message space by a ` `.


This command allows the user to input the song name rather than by index and hence once the command message has been split. The splitting is performed by the  `message.split(" ")`. 

The exact song is obtained by calling the `findSong` function of songList. If the array sent by songList is smaller than 1, then the song doesnt exists and a Ducats exception is thrown. 

    songList.findSong(songName); 

The respective bar array is obtained by calling the `getBars()` function for each song obtained and the combiner class is invoked. 

If there is a repeat parameter, we will call the `repeatLoop` function. This uses an iterator is used to loop through the bar list and check if the current index is greater than or equal to the required index and perform the combineBar function, which splits each bar into chords and combines the chords using the arrayList combination. 

If there isnt a repeat parameter,then we just get the bar to be overlayed from the array and call the combiner's combineBar() function. 

After which, we call the updatefile function of storage to store the new song and then return the string from the execute function of ascii to properly display the new song to the user through the UI. 

Below is the action sequence diagram (Figure 1.6): 


image::overlay_bar_song_actionsequence.png[]
Figure 1.6 - `overlay_bar_song` action sequence diagram

==== overlay_group_group

`overlay_group_group`: 

`overlay_group_group <song_name to be overlayed from> <group_number> <song_name to be overlayed to> <group_number>` 


Allows the users to overlay a group from one song to another. The interesting aspect of this feature is that it allows the users to overlay groups of unequal length, i.e. a group with a larger number of bars onto a group with a smaller number of bars and vice versa. The following example shows what will happen when combining two unequal groups:  


* Group 1: {Bar X Bar Y} 
* Group 2 : {Bar A Bar B Bar C Bar D}
* Overlaying Group 1 onto Group 2:  { [Bar A + Bar X] [Bar B + Bar Y] [Bar C + Bar X] [Bar D + Bar Y]}   
* Overlaying Group 2 onto Group 1: { [Bar A + Bar X] [Bar B + Bar Y]} 

It works similarly to the above two commands but the only difference is the way it handles unequal groups as it gets ratio of the two groups (i.e. the number of bars in group_1): 

    int numberOfTimes = (int) Math.ceil(barCopiedTo.size() / (barBeCopiedFrom.size() * 1.0));

The value is rounded up using the `Math.ceil` function as this gives us the upper bound for the number of times the barBeCopiedFrom needs to be repeated. After which we loop through the tobeCopiedFrom array and combine it with the toCopiedTo bars. A variable is used to keep count to ensure one doesnt access. 


==== overlay_bar_group 


Allows the users to overlay a  bar onto a group from the same song. It works in the similar way as the `overlay` commands. The repeat parameter allows the user to overlay through all the groups from the specified starting group. 

`overlay_bar_group <bar_number> <group_number>`

The group number can be obtained from the `list_group` function. 

=== Logging

This feature allows our app to constantly log important information that the user inputs to better understand the user behavior in our application. Logging also helps us identify command pathways in the app that lead to unexpected bugs and we can remedy them without asking the user to repeat their actions. Furthermore, in the future, we can train our AI depending on how the amateur musicians learn and to give them a better learning experience. 



== Adding a New Function

When creating a new command for Ducats, one must first create a class separately for this command. This class must extend the abstract class Command.  One must also implement the method execute which is in charge of executing the command depending on the user’s input. Furthermore, the parser class must be changed to include the command, by editing the switch case. It should also be included in the Ducats class’s run method. It can be included by using c instance of <Class Name> .If the undo-redo function is not applicable to the implemented command, then it must be included the nested if statement in the code (Refer to Figure 1.3) . Furthermore the command must be included in the  WordGetter class’s commandList array of String (Figure 1.4 for more details).

== Testing
We have used Junit Testing for our application and have done extensive testing on each feature. We have tried to be as broad in our test cases and used `jacoco` as way to test the extensiveness of our tests. We have achieved an overall extensiveness for our commands to be 78%. We will continue to increase this in the upcoming versions.
