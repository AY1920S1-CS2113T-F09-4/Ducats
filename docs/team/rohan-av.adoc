== PROJECT: Ducats
'''
== About the Project

As part of the module CS2113T Software Engineering and Object-Oriented Programming, my team and I were assigned the task of improving upon a command line interface to-do list application known as Duke. To better reflect our interests and abilities, we chose to morph the existing project into a music composition app called Ducats geared towards amateurs but usable by anyone who is interested in music.

As the team lead, my primary responsibilities were to keep track of overall team progress, delegate tasks, and design the overall software architecture. Functionally, my role was to implement persistent storage, the open feature, and the metronome feature. The following sections will elaborate on these contributions, with excerpts from the user and developer guides added when appropriate.

== Summary of Contributions

Over the past few weeks, there have been several contributions made by me to the team project, and this section serves as a summary for these contributions.

*Enhancements added:*

* Persistent Storage

_What it does_: Persistent storage stores all the data in the form of a folder containing .txt files such that Ducats will keep the data upon its closure

_Justification_: Firstly, Ducats is able to retain all the data upon its closure, ensuring that the user does not experience data loss. Secondly, human-readable data storage makes exporting and importing songs easy.

_Highlights_: Storage had to be implemented with the consideration of a huge amount of features and the extremely intricate data present in the form of musical compositions. This caused the parsing and string conversion to be complicated to implement.

* Open functionality

_What it does_: The open command (`OpenCommand`) opens one song for editing.

_Justification_: This is important as it ensures that only one song is being manipulated at one time, resulting in the data of the rest of the songs being protected.

_Highlights_: The original SongList object had to be refactored in order to implement `OpenCommand`.

* Metronome functionality

_What it does_: The metronome command calls upon the metronome class to display an on-screen metronome.

_Justification_: An in-built metronome helps significantly with the testing of rhythm and meter, especially for amateurs who are unsure of the musicality or mood of a specific rhythm or tempo.

*Code contributed:* You can view samples of my code for the above mentioned features link:https://nuscs2113-ay1920s1.github.io/dashboard/#=undefined&search=rohan-av[here].

*Other contributions:*

*	Project Management:
**	All the releases on GitHub were managed by me, and I played a major role in the scheduling of features to be implemented and bugs to be fixed for each release.
*	Library Integration:
**	I integrated ShadowJAR and Checkstyle early on, followed by Jacoco later on to determine test coverage. I also integrated Codecov with Travis-CI.
** Logging was also setup in Ducats by me.
*	Team Leadership:
**	As the team leader, I made sure issues were closed on time and pull requests went through appropriate vetting before being merged.

== Contributions to the User Guide

The following section displays my additions to the Ducats User Guide, namely my description of the metronome and data storage features.

_(Excerpt from Ducats User Guide starts here. For a guide on the formatting used for the commands, please refer to the preface of link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-F09-4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#features[Section 4])_

=== Starting a metronome: `metronome`

Rhythm is an essential part of musical composition, and it is useful to have a visual or aural cue regarding the different types of rhythm possible, especially for amateurs. To facilitate this, a metronome feature is included, where the user can cause a metronome to appear on the screen on the screen for a specific number of bars.

_Format_:
`metronome n/DURATION_IN_BARS n/TEMPO s/TIME_SIGNATURE`

_Example_:
`metronome 10 120 4/4` will start a metronome for 10 bars, each consisting of four notes, with a tempo of 120 beats per minute.

The metronome can be started from anywhere, and the only step is to type in the command according to the format provided above. Upon pressing 'Enter', the metronome will appear on the screen. The numbers 1 through 4 will appear in sequence for 10 times, with each change in number happening every half-second. The number 1 will be accompanied by a hash ('#') for emphasis, as the first beat of every bar is considered more significant in music.

Upon execution, the user interface will output 'Done!', and you are free to key in your next command.

=== Saving the data

All of the song data is saved to the hard disk automatically after any modifications have been made through a command. There is no need to save manually. To access the data in order to export or import songs, simply access the `data` folder in the directory that contains the program file. By putting in `.txt` files of the same data format, the data will be imported seamlessly the next time you start up Ducats. Additionally, you can also edit the data directly on the `.txt` file if you need to make minor changes to the data without booting up Ducats.

[NOTE]
Direct data manipulation is only recommended for more advanced users. Ducats will be unable to read your song data if it detects an invalid format.

The data found in the `.txt` file is structured as follows:

    NAME KEY TEMPO
    BAR_1
    BAR_2
    ...
    BAR_N
    groups:
    GROUP_1_NAME BAR_1 ... BAR_N
    ...
    GROUP_N_NAME BAR_1 ... BAR_N

Each bar, represented above by `BAR_1`, `BAR_2` and so on, is formatted as follows, with the segments representing each individual bar, chord and note being labelled with B, C and N respectively:

    [[UAs;UCs],[UA;UC],[UA;UC],[UA;UC],[MCs;LDs],[MC;LD],[MC;UDs],[MC,UD]]
    |----------------------------------B---------------------------------|
     |---C---|
      |N|

[NOTE]
The above bar is populated with different chords and notes for the purposes of demonstration.

Since the default time signature of a Song you create is in 4 4, each Bar consists of eight Chords.The “s”, if present, signifies that that Note that has the duration of a 1/8 note is the start of a bigger Note object or one of the same duration. For example, in the above visualization, the Bar consists of an Upper A Note with the duration of 1/2 and an Upper C Note with the same duration in the first four chords.

Additionally, I worked on Section 5: Introduction to Basic Music Theory, which you can view in the link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-F09-4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[User Guide].

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

The following section shows my additions to Ducats' Developer Guide, namely the section explaining the overall architecture, the section explaining the parsing and execution of commands, the section explaining navigation, and the section explaining the storage.

_(Excerpt from Ducats Developer Guide starts here)_

=== Overall Architecture

Ducats consists of multiple components implemented as objects that work together to fulfill the program's objectives. Figure 1 below showcases the high-level architecture of Ducats:

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture_Diagram.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Ducats, the main class, is responsible for the initialization of the different components, as well as the highest level of logic.

DucatsLogger is a common class used by many of the components in order to log information, warnings and errors in a `.log` file.

Other than the two components mentioned above, the rest of the components are linked in a way reminiscent of an n-tier architectural style, with the higher-level components making use of the services provided by the lower-level components. The remaining seven components are as follows:

* `UI`: interacts with the console (reading and writing)
* `Parser`: parses the input command and creates of the appropriate Command object
* `WordGetter`: suggests the correct command to the user if the user misspells his command
* `Command`: executed to modify the UI, SongList and Storage
* `SongList`: contains the list of Song objects
* `Metronome`: displays a visual metronome on screen when initialized through a `MetronomeCommand`
* `StorageParser`: parses data in persistent storage and converts song data to a form friendly to be stored in persistent storage
* `Storage`: Reads data from and writes data to persistent storage in the hard disk

Each of these classes have their API illustrated in their respective files.

=== Command Parsing and Execution

Since Ducats is a CLI app, it works by reading user input and carrying out the command the user wants it to execute. In line with this objective, the different components of Ducats have been designed to interact in the sequence as depicted by Figure 2.

.Command Parsing and Execution Sequence Diagram
image::Command_Sequence_Diagram.png[scaledwidth=90%]

In the above diagram, 'XYZ' is used to represent a general command or function. There are several different types of possible commands that can be created after parsing, and hence the object is labelled "XYZCommand". Similarly, to format the output string, there are multiple method within the UI class of doing so, hence being represented here by "XYZFormat()".

It can be seen that, for all commands, the `Parser` class is used to determine what type of command the user intends for the program to execute. In accordance with this, a new `Command` object is created and then the `execute()` method of the Command is called, modifying the `SongList` and `Storage`, and returning a String to be displayed on the console through the `UI` class.

A slightly different schedule is used for the Metronome functionality, which will be discussed in further detail in Section 4.5.

=== Storage and StorageParser

In order to ensure that the songs the user has created, deleted or modified can be retrieved even after exiting Ducats, a form of persistent storage is needed. This is implemented as a folder containing `.txt` files, and a `Storage` class that will interact with the said folder to read and modify its contents. Since the `Storage` class can create and modify files, it is important to understand the exact procedures executed within the class for the reading and writing of files. The two swimlane diagrams below display the sequence of events, as well as how the `Storage` class interacts with the `StorageParser` class. Each activity is annotated with the function within which it occurs for easy reference.

.Reading files (for each file)
image::storage_read.png[scaledwidth=90%]

Before reading from the files, an assertion is made for the file list of the data folder (obtained through the `File.listFiles()` method) to not be null. The reading process as described in Figure 3 is then repeated for each file in the file list.

.Writing to files (for each song)
image::storage_write.png[scaledwidth=90%]

Regardless of whether the `.txt` file corresponding to the specific song exists, the `Storage` class will attempt the creation of the file to ensure its existence. Due to the modification of data being involved, changes to the files are logged by DucatsLogger.

_Data Format:_

In order to convert each Song object to a human-readable String, and to be able to parse it back, a format must be decided for the storing of the Song object in persistent storage. The following format has been adopted:

    NAME KEY TEMPO
    BAR_1
    BAR_2
    ...
    BAR_N
    groups:
    GROUP_1_NAME BAR_1 ... BAR_N
    ...
    GROUP_N_NAME BAR_1 ... BAR_N

Each `BAR_N`, where N is a positive integer, is formatted as follows, with the segments representing each individual bar, chord and note being labelled with B, C and N respectively:

    [[UAs;UCs],[UA;UC],[UA;UC],[UA;UC],[MCs;LDs],[MC;LD],[MC;UDs],[MC,UD]]
    |----------------------------------B---------------------------------|
     |---C---|
      |N|

For each String representing a Note object, the first two characters correspond to the pitch (ranging from Pitch.LOWER_C to Pitch.UPPER_C while passing through Pitch.MIDDLE_C). An exception for this convention would be Rest, which is represented as “RT”. The “s”, if present, signifies that the unit Note that has the duration of an eighth note is the start of a bigger Note object or one of the same duration. For example, in the above visualization, the Bar consists of an Upper A Note with the duration of half and an Upper C Note with the same duration in the first four chords.

By implementing the storage in this way, we are able to ensure that the data is both storage-friendly as well as human-readable and editable. To construct the data to be stored in the `.txt` file, the `StorageParser` class invokes the toString() methods for the Song, Bar, Chord and Note classes for each Song in the Song list in a tree-like fashion. Inversely, in order for the StorageParser class to parse the data found in the `.txt` file into Song objects that are to be stored in the SongList, the `convertSongFromString(String s)` method is defined.

_Design Considerations_:

* Using a single `.txt` file to store all the data
** _Pros_: easier implementation of `Storage`
** _Cons_: harder for the user to import and export files without corrupting the data, hard for the user to view the data if the song is too long due to line length limits

We have decided to use a storage directory that contains `.txt` files, each containing a single song's data. With this neater implementation, it is easy for the user to export and import songs by just copying out or inserting `.txt` files of the same format respectively.

In addition to these, I also worked on the Section 4.2.1 Creating a Song and Navigation, which you can view in the link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-F09-4/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[Developer Guide].
